		<p>Wassup my name is Master Lord Keith Jr. I was born on August 14, 2004. I am  a first year scholar at SMASH. I am a real cool, funny, smart, outgoing, sometimes chill, and an individual person. Coming up for me was good. I kinda lived the privileged life style. What I mean by that is I never really needed nor wanted for anything. I was fortunate enough to not have to go through a lot of stuggles that a lot of people in my age group has gone through. I like interacting with people, laughing, eating tacos, and making people laugh.</p> </div>

	<p>If we are cool or you know me, you know that the one thing I love is my mom. I LOVE my mom more than any other person and/or thing and/or place on this planet. I am extremely grateful for my mom. She's always there when I need her, and I know that if I ever need anything she'll be there. I know that if I ever need anyone I can go to my my just to have somebody to lean on in times of hardship. She is the best thing to have ever happened to me, and will always and forever be that. I love my mom and will always be there for her just as she will always be here for me. When I make it she will be the one foreshore person who will never have to worry about anything again. She's the reason I want to be great and successful. Every morning I wake up all I think is to grind for my mom. Do great for her, and make her feel proud of me. She is my reason to wake up everymorning, she is my reason to do great in school, she is my reason for living, she is my reason for learning, and she is reason for the road I've chosen to take.</p>
